# Minimal MLX Conversion Dependency

This directory is a minimal, trimmed-down copy of the official [mlx-examples](https://github.com/ml-explore/mlx-examples) repository.

**Only the `mlx_lm/convert.py` script and its dependencies are kept for model conversion.**

- Do not use this directory for general MLX examples or tutorials.
- For the full set of MLX examples, see the official repo: https://github.com/ml-explore/mlx-examples
