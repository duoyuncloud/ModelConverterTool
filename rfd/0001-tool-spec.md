## Abstract
This document describes the technical specification, architecture, and design rationale for the Model Converter Tool. It aims to provide a comprehensive reference for contributors and maintainers.

## Motivation
- Need for a unified tool to convert, quantize, and manage machine learning models across diverse formats and frameworks.
- Simplify deployment and interoperability for research and production.

## Technical Design
### Architecture Overview
- Modular core with pluggable conversion engines
- CLI and API interfaces
- Batch processing and configuration support

### Core Components
- `ModelConverterAPI`: Main entry point for programmatic usage
- Conversion engines: GGUF, ONNX, FP16, AWQ, MLX, etc.
- CLI: Command-line interface for end users
- Configuration: YAML/JSON batch job definitions
- History and logging modules

### Data Flow
1. User invokes CLI or API
2. Input model and parameters are validated
3. Appropriate conversion engine is selected
4. Model is loaded, processed, and converted
5. Output is saved and history is recorded

### Extensibility
- New engines can be added via the `engine/` module
- Configurable via external YAML/JSON files

## Alternatives
- Manual conversion scripts for each format
- Existing tools (e.g., HuggingFace Transformers, ONNX converters)

## Security Considerations
- Input validation to prevent malicious model files
- Safe handling of file paths and permissions

## Drawbacks
- Maintenance overhead for supporting many formats
- Dependency management for various backends
