## Abstract
Technical specification, architecture, and design rationale for the Model Converter Tool.

## Motivation
- Unified tool for converting, quantizing, and managing ML models across formats.
- Simplifies deployment and interoperability.

## Technical Design
### Architecture Overview
- Modular core with pluggable conversion engines
- CLI and API interfaces
- Batch processing and configuration support

### Core Components
- `ModelConverterAPI`: Main programmatic entry point
- Conversion engines: GGUF, ONNX, FP16, AWQ, MLX, etc.
- CLI: Command-line interface
- Configuration: YAML/JSON batch jobs
- History and logging modules

### Data Flow
1. User invokes CLI or API
2. Input model and parameters are validated
3. Appropriate engine is selected
4. Model is loaded, processed, and converted
5. Output is saved and history is recorded

### Extensibility
- Add new engines via the `engine/` module
- Configurable via YAML/JSON files

## Alternatives
- Manual conversion scripts for each format
- Existing tools (e.g., HuggingFace Transformers, ONNX converters)

## Security Considerations
- Input validation to prevent malicious files
- Safe handling of file paths and permissions

## Drawbacks
- Maintenance overhead for many formats
- Dependency management for various backends
